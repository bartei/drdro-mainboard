# Full-board review findings — 2026-07-04

Netlist: Netlist_Schematic1_2026-07-04.net (145 comp / 120 nets at review time).
Full audit incl. MCU pin-function check vs F411 AF table, reset, boot0, all I/O.

> **Re-verified 2026-07-04** against the current export (**171 comp / 133 nets,
> zero dangling nets**): findings below still hold; deltas ticked inline.
> `STATUS.md` is the authoritative status. Biggest open item now: the encoder
> 5-chip-per-DB9 + index-Z restructure (see `encoder_input_todo.md`).

## 🔴 Critical (blocks bring-up)
- [x] MCU VDD pin 19 + VSS pin 18 — FIXED & verified: 18→GND, 19→3V3, all 5
      VDD/VSS pairs now wired.

## 🟠 Should-fix
- [x] Orphaned motor pull-ups — FIXED: reconnected to M*_OUT nets (+ CN6/CN7),
      no more dangling.
- [x] M3_DIR moved off PC13 → PC3. Also M2_STEP/DIR, M3_STEP → PC0/PC1/PC2.
      All normal GPIOs; vacated pins freed; no double-assignment. Verified all
      7 channels MCU→ULN→connector.
- [ ] 🔵 Connector grouping heads-up: motor 2 split across CN6 (M2_STEP) and
      CN7 (M2_DIR). Electrically fine; regroup per-motor if desired. CN6/CN7
      are signal-only (no GND/5V) → assume opto-isolated drivers, COM→driver +V.
- [ ] I2C: add SDA/SCL pull-ups + ESD footprints (expansion bus, still missing).
- [ ] Encoder front-end: only 3 shared quad receivers (A/B, no Z) — the agreed
      5-chip-per-DB9 + index-Z restructure is still owed. See encoder_input_todo.md.

## ✅ Verified correct
- [x] All 5 encoders on TIM1-5 CH1/CH2 (hardware quadrature) — pin choice good
- [x] USART1 / I2C1 / SPI2 / SWD / crystal on valid AF pins
- [x] Reset circuit (pull-up + steering diodes + button)
- [x] BOOT0 circuit (pull-down + button)
- [x] Encoder receivers direct to MCU; no 5V on non-tolerant pins
- [x] Decoupling improved (11 caps on 3V3)

## 🔵 FYI / firmware
- STEP pins not on free timers (TIM1-5 = encoders) → GPIO/DMA step gen only
- ENC5 firmware: use TIM5 (AF2) not TIM2
- JTAG pins repurposed — SWD-only debug (fine)

## W5500 Ethernet (added 2026-07-04) — mostly correct
- [x] Crystal load caps → 18pF (C28/C31). CORRECT for the X322525MOB4SI which
      is a 12pF-CL crystal (2×(12−~3pF stray)=18pF → ~12pF effective CL). Note:
      earlier "match to 18pF" was right by luck; crystal is 12pF-CL not 18pF.
- [x] Crystal case pins (X3 pins 2,4) grounded.
- [ ] SPI NSS (PB12→W5500 SCSn): wiring correct. FIRMWARE: drive PB12 as GPIO
      software CS (not HW-NSS) so SCSn frames each W5500 SPI transaction (VDM).
- [ ] 🟠 Optional: add ~10k pull-up on SCSn→3V3 (defined deselect at boot).
- [ ] 🔵 Optional: add 1MΩ feedback (XI-XO) + 0Ω series on XO per ref (Fig 3).
- [x] SPI mapping correct (MOSI-MOSI/MISO-MISO, SCSn→PB12, no swap); INTn/RSTn
      →PC6/PC7 with pull-ups — verified vs datasheet Fig 4
- [x] EXRES1 12.4k 1%→AGND, 1V2O 10nF, TOCAP 4.7µF — all per WIZnet ref
- [x] AVDD ferrite+decoupling, center-tap 3V3 via ferrite+0.1µF, PMODE=111
- [x] TX/RX pairs + MagJack + LEDs correct; NC pins (7,12,13,18,24,26,46,47) ok

## ⚪ Minor / carryover
- [ ] RESET optional 100nF cap to GND
- [x] SPI (PB12-15) now wired to W5500 (SCSn/SCLK/MISO/MOSI + INTn/RSTn) — verified
- [ ] Carryover verify: U5 SIT3088 EP→GND, crystal load caps vs CL, ISO_IN
      firmware pull-ups
